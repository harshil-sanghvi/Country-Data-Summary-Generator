# Mobile-Phone-Activity-Data-Search

This file contains my source code which implements the definition assigned to me i.e. generating the summary of country code given to us and displaying the top 10 countries having maximum internet and callin usage. It does the main task of taking country code from user and then displaying the data associated with that country code from text file. It also finds and prints the top 10 countries which have maximum internet usage and top 10 countries which have most callin usage. It is the main soul of program which consists of all logic and coding. 




Following concepts of Object-Oriented Programming have been incorporated in this program:

1)	Method overloading (2 same methods having the same name and number of parameters but of different type and having a different body)

2)	Exception Handling (try-catch and throws)
3)	Constructor (created a class with parameterized constructor)
4)	ArrayList (As my program demanded dynamic array implementation and also facilitates the sorting process)

5)	HashSet (to keep track of repeated items)
6)	File Handling (to read data from .txt file)
7)	Comparator Interface (To find countries with top 10 internet and callin usages i.e. descending order)

8)	Basic OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods, classes implementing an interface, static keyword)
